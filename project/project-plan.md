# Project Plan

## Summary
<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 5 sentences. -->
The relationship between the traffic lights and trafic volations can be understood by merging reported fines data from the year 2021(past datasets are also available from 2015 but for now we are only using first 3 months of 2021) with the dataset of traffic lights in Cologne.
## Rationale
<!-- Outline the impact of the analysis, e.g. which pains it solves. -->
To evaluate the effectiveness of traffic signal placement, look at the relationship between the occurrence of violations and the presence of traffic lights.
The project intends to deliver practical insights that may be utilized to make data-driven decisions for enhancing traffic management and safety in Cologne by merging the information and doing a thorough analysis.

## Datasources
<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

Short description:
Traffic lights (traffic lights) in Cologne (location, LSA number, building authority and district).

Additional information: These are the locations of traffic lights. The localization reflects the relevant crossing point of traffic flows, the location controlled by a control device of a traffic light system. The scope of control of an installation can cover a larger area up to 75 m away from this point.

The source of the data is the inventory of traffic signals at the Office for Traffic Management. The data is updated at the beginning of each year.
